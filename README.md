# 🧠 SExpres-Python


This is a basic Python CLI (Command Line Interface) program that guides the user through a flow of interactions involving name input, options display, and an action based on user choice.


## 🚀 How It Works

When you run the program:

1. The user is asked to input their name (`nameView`).
2. The available options are shown (`optionsView`).
3. The user makes a choice and the corresponding action is performed (`choiceOp`).

All logic is modularized for clarity and easy maintenance.

## ▶️ Running the Program

Make sure you have Python 3 installed, then run:

```bash 
python app.py
```
## 📦 Dependencies

This project uses only standard Python libraries — no external packages required.

## 🛠️ Customization

You can expand this project by editing the files in the defs/ folder. Each module is isolated and can be improved independently.
